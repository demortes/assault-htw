Attacking Guidelines
a.  Attacking of Novices
    i.  This is not permitted. A novice is defined as:
        *   A player that has less than 5 hours, noticeable by the 'Newbie'
            flag on the who list or by the color of their base (Cyan).
        *   A player that is obviously a novice through experience.
        
            Note: When in doubt, ask an immortal. If there are no immortals
                to ask, it is best not to attack.
                
   ii.	The only exception to the above statement is if the novice attacks
        you personally. If he/she is attacking an ally, you are NOT to
        intervene. If your ally cannot handle the novice themselves, it is
        then a learning experience for them.

b.  Attacking Other Players
    i.  You are allowed to:
        *   Attack a base with a group of people.
        *   Capture and/or blow up the entire base.
        *   Attack again if you are killed.
   ii.  You are NOT allowed to:
        *   Attack for hours without progress. Also, you may not continue
            attacking if you die numerous times without dealing significant
            damage. This would be a good time to return to your base and
            refine your strategy; you may then return at a different time to
            try again.
        *   Wipe someone's base twice within 5 hours.
        *   Disallow someone from rebuilding a defendable base before 
            attacking again.

c.  Immortal Bases:
    i.  You are allowed to attack a base created by an Immortal.
   ii.  You must note that by doing so, the Immortal may then do with you as
        he/she pleases.
  iii.  If asked, you must stop. It may be used for an event hosted by that
        Immortal.

If you believe someone is breaking these rules, once you know they have been
informed of the rules, do not complain on public channesl, please. Tell an
immortal. This is to preserve the atmosphere of friendly competition.
