The immortals of Assault don't try to limit their players with complicated
rules, only because that would take away from the enjoyability of the game.
We do however expect the players to follow a few simples rules put forth
for the good of the game. They have been grouped, and are listed below.

@@y|> @@aAttacking
@@y|> @@aCheating 
@@y|> @@aImmortals
@@y|> @@aAtmosphere@@N

To view these rules, type 'rules &lt;keyword&gt;'. For example, to view the
attacking guidelines, type '@@Grules attacking@@N'.

Note, however, that these rules are not set in stone; they are subject to
the individual interpretation of the immortal staff. If you find an
immortal's enforcement to be unfair, contact a higher mortal by any means.

The chain of command is listed in the @@Gwizlist@@N.
