Atmospheric Preservation
The atmosphere we generally hope to achieve and preserve on Assault is one of
friendly competition. If there is someone you dislike, and would as soon not
even associate with, there is the '@@Gignore@@N' command. (See: @@yHelp Ignore@@N)

a.  Swearing
    i.  Constant swearing will not be tolerated.
   ii.  If asked, you must stop immediately.
  iii.  You are allowed to swear, but to an extent. Swearing at someone is
        allowed, but ANY form of racism, sexism, or otherwise discriminatory
        comments will result in an immediate ban.

b.  Player-to-Player Respect
    i.  Speaking in foreign languages (non-English) with ill intention* for
        long periods of time is not permitted. If you can't speak English,
        how have you connected and made it through login?
        *   Ill intention is defined as not telling someone what it means
            when asked, or insulting/cursing at others. If you do not tell
            someone what something means, (Truthfuly) it is considered ill
            intentioned and is therefore punishable.
   ii.  After attacking someone, extreme gloating and/or insulting is deeply
        frowned upon. Yes, it stirs up competition, but flaming others to
        such an extent only begets more flaming. We sincerely appreciate it
        when players help those out that they just annihilated; oftentimes
        these players will be rewarded for their generosity and respect.
  
        That being said, we equally appreciate when players who have just
        been annihilated ask for help, rather than flame their attackers.
        Everyone loses bases, it's the whole point of the game. So don't
        feel bad when you fail to defend, ask how you could have defended
        your base better.
  iii.  The basic idea here is this: We are people. Treat us that way.
