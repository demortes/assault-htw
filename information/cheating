Cheating
    a.	In-Game Cheating
        i.  This includes, but is not limited to:
            *   Abusing bugs/not reporting ones you find.
            *   Allowing friends/allies to kill you/your base for their gain.
            *   Building next to an alliance member in a way that, when one
                member is logged off, the other member has a building that is
                unreachable.
            *   Using triggers for automated games.
    b.  Character Cheating
        i.  You are NOT allowed to:
            *   Have an alternative character without an administrator’s 
                permission.
            *   Have two or more characters connected from the same IP.
            
                Note: Siblings are very welcome to play, but you must first get
                    an approval from an Immortal ahead of time. Demortes or
                    Grave will have to add you to a list that will allow them
                    online from the same IP address.
                        
    c.  Selling/Giving
        i.  You may not give/sell buildings to ANYONE.
       ii.  If it is questionable, ASK!
