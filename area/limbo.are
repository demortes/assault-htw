@@g Under the Guides section.                                                
@@g                                                                          
@@g Here is a brief version of what your starting steps should be:           
@@g                                                                          
@@g 1) You should find a good building location                              
@@g   a) Move around by using the directional commands (N/S/E/W to go North, 
@@g  South, East and West)                                                   
@@g   b) Use the RUN command to move multiple rooms at once (run 5 e   will  
@@g  run 5 rooms east)                                                       
@@g   c) Search the map for a mountain range, composed of Hill sectors (@@b--@@g)  
@@g  and Mountain sectors (two @@bbrown@@g squiggly lines)                                               
@@g   d) Buliding near forests is also good                                  
@@g   e) Volcanos (Mountain sectors with Lava, o-@@g, in them) are only good if 
@@g  you can build a lumberyard elsewhere (For a list, read "help            
@@g  lumberyard")                                                            
@@g                                                                          
@@g 2) Build your Headquarters                                               
@@g   a) It should be a few rooms away from the mountain, or wherever you    
@@g  plan to put your resource buildings.                                    
@@g   b) Make sure you have plenty of open terrain (Field, rocks, sand,      
@@g  snow) to build the rest of your base                                    
@@g   c) Type "build headquarters" to make it                                
@@g                                                                          
@@g 3) Build your resource buildings                                         
@@g   a) If you type "build", you'll see a list of buildings you can make    
@@g   b) Build the buildings under the RESOURCES section                     
@@g   c) The recommended amounts to have are:                                
@@g        8 Mines                                                           
@@g        3 Lumberyards                                                     
@@g        2 Quarries                                                        
@@g        1 Tannery                                                         
@@g   d) Tip, start with the lumberyards                                     
@@g                                                                          
@@g 4) Build the rest of your stuff                                          
@@g   a) Type "build" to see what you can make.                              
@@g   b) Build your armory, warehouse and gatherer (Read help gatherer)      
@@g   c) Pick a lab, build it, then build all the other stuff...

@@g This game sends a very large amount of data to your client. Sometimes,   
@@g this causes your client to disconnect from the MUD. There are a few ways 
@@g of dealing with the problem:                                             
@@g                                                                          
@@g                                                                          
@@a Decreasing Map Size:                                                     
@@a 1)@@c Use the Map@@c command to decrease the map size (Map 12. Default is 16)  
@@a 2)@@c Use the Config +SMALLMAP@@c option to force the map to show 2 symbols    
@@c    per square instead of 4.                                              
                                                                          
@@a The other, much better, way:                                             
@@a MCCP@@c stands for Mud Client Compression Protocol. Basically, it works     
@@c like Winzip for MUD data, and compresses the data by over 90%, meaning   
@@c the game's lag is reduced by about that much. Some clients, such as Zmud 
@@c or Mushclient, already have MCCP support (check your score, upper-right  
@@c corner), and for those who don't, there's a program called MCClient,     
@@c which is a small side-program you run in the background and connect to   
@@c (instead of connecting directly to the game), and it gives you the       
@@c benifits of having MCCP.

0 level levels~
Building levels range from 1 to 5. At each level, a building produces
better things, or produces things more often. (Usually, the resource-
generating buildings will produce more often at higher levels, and other
item-generating buildings will produce better items. Also, defense towers
have better accuracy/damage when their level is higher)
 
To upgrade your building's level, you must acquire some blueprints by
either blowing up another person's building, or by questing (Or maybe
you can buy them), and use the "Upgrade" command.

The game supports the MXP, MSP and MCCP protocols.
 
MXP - MUD Expension Protocol - Right now, if you use an MXP-supporting client such as Zmud or Mushclient, you can 
place your mouse pointer over a building on the map, and you will get information about it. You can also click on it 
for easy targetting (For war cannons). Also, you can click on exit names (while in a building) to go there.
 
MSP - MUD Sound Protocol - Enable it with "config +sound", and play the game... There are explosions, firing, empty 
clips...
 
MCCP - Enables automatically when you log on, if your client supports it, it will compress the data sent from the mud 
to your computer, greatly reducing lag and disconnections... It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you get a client that 
supports it!

Viruses...
 
Viruses are small little programs that, once they get into your system, can disable your building. This is how they 
work:
 
Step 1) A hacker connects to your computer, cracks the password, bypasses the defenses, and sends you the virus - The 
process may take a few minutes, but if the hacker knows what they're doing, you may not be alerted about it. During 
that time, you can go to the attacked building and type "Computer Defend" to try to throw the hacker outside. If the 
system has been breeched, you might want to "Reset" your building password as well.
 
Step 2) Lets say you couldn't stop the virus on time. Now, it's in your system. You have to use the "Computer Repair" 
command, which is longer and has less chance of success.
 
Step 3) If you can't repair the virus on time, it may catch on to other buildings in your base!
 
If a building is infected by a virus, it will be disabled - It will not function at all.

The Year: 2015
Countries all over the world are laying down their arms and dismantling their military, but not for the reasons many 
had hoped for.
A powerful terrorist cell, known only as the HTW, has recently surfaced and obtained a powerful and very large 
neuclear device. It took no more than a few months before the UN could find no other option but to surrender to the 
terrorists' demands, who by then have developped their neuclear technology even further.
 
The Year: 2018
A Terrorist government has taken control over the settlements that have survived the revolution. Fear and pain have 
become a way of life, any anyone showing any resistance is immediately killed.

The Year: 2047
Over 30 years after the revolution, cracks began to form in the HTW after their leader died of unknown causes. The 
struggle for power within the terrorist government had left it weak.
Knowing there won't be many similar oppertunities, and using pirated signals to transmit to any radio or television 
set, which were both banned after the takeover, many groups of former soldiers from all accross the globe formed under 
this giant threat. The biggest one, the "Fighting Rebellion against Earth's Enemies", or F.R.E.E, has managed to 
infiltrate the terrorist organization, and began setting up an attack.

The Year: 2052
After 5 years of undercover work and planning, the F.R.E.E was ready to carry out their plan. They set up a home base 
in central europe, and gathered supporters and soldiers. The head of the HTW was running some errands in Africa, and 
he left the European centers weak.
 
@@xOperation: Assault: High Tech War@@N
 
The Assault went better than anyone expected - The European terrorist bases were almost empty, and the ones who were 
there surrendered quickly. There were hardly any casualties on either side.
In the European HTW Headquarters, F.R.E.E members were celebrating in the main communications center, transmitting 
messages all around the world about their victory. Then suddenly, in the middle of the little party, the wall-length 
monitor flickered, and a dark image appeared. He then started speaking, explaining how he knew about their little 
strike operation, then shifted their attention to the "Dementor" - The original nuclear bomb that won the war for the 
terrorists, which was placed a hundred feet beneath the base.
 
In a glance, Europe was destroyed.
 
The once huge continent crumbled apart into small, mostly radioactive, islands. But people survived, on both sides, 
and in the frustration and confusion, formed their own militias. The largest of islands, nicknamed the New Dusk, 
contained hundreds of small military groups, all feeding on technology saved and made public after the assault on the 
HTW communications center.
 
@@xYou are one of these soldiers.

Or are you one of the remaining terrorist cells on the island?
